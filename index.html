            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>  My journey into the world of technology has been anything but traditional. I originally pursued a degree in biomedical studies because of my deep curiosity about science, health, and the human body. However, even during my academic years, I always found myself drawn to computers, problem-solving, and exploring how digital tools could be applied to improve everyday life. That passion for technology never faded, and it eventually guided me to make a bold transition from the biomedical field into information and communication technology (ICT).
                </p>
                <p>
                After college, I began training in ICT to formally ground myself in the technical skills I had been informally exploring for years. I quickly discovered that technology was not just a hobby for me—it was a calling. My first steps into the tech industry were as a WordPress developer, where I built and customized websites for individuals and small businesses. These early experiences were invaluable, giving me both a sense of confidence and the practical know-how to translate creative ideas into functional digital solutions. Working with clients taught me the importance of clear communication, attention to detail, and designing with the end user in mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                As my skills grew, so did my ambition. I realized that while WordPress gave me a strong foundation in web development, I wanted to deepen my understanding of programming and software engineering. This led me to enroll in the Full-Stack Software Engineering program at <span>Moringa School</span>. At Moringa, I am expanding my expertise in modern web technologies, programming languages, and frameworks that enable me to build scalable, robust applications from the ground up. The program has been both challenging and rewarding, sharpening not only my technical skills but also my problem-solving, teamwork, and project management abilities.
