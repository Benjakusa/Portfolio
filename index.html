            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I began my academic journey in biomedical studies, but my passion for technology was too strong to set aside. After college, I transitioned into ICT training and officially began my tech journey. I started out as a WordPress developer, building and managing websites, and over time my curiosity and drive to grow led me deeper into the world of software development.</p><br>
            <p>Today, I am enrolled in a Full-Stack Software Engineering program at <span>Moringa School</span>, where I am sharpening my skills to create impactful digital solutions. My goal is to leverage technology not only to achieve personal growth but also to make a meaningful impact on the world around me.</p>
